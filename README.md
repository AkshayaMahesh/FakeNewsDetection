By using this dataset, we can develop a 🤖model🤖 to predict whether a news article is real or fake 🤥. The dataset contains 5️⃣ columns and 23,481 rows, including the following variables:

Title of the news article 📝
Text in that news article 📜
Subject of the article 📰
Date when it is published 📅
Category of the news article 🗞️
To train our model, we'll use popular machine learning libraries such as 🐍Python, 🧬NumPy, 📊Pandas, and 🤖PyTorch. After training the model, we'll evaluate its accuracy 🎯 and create a confusion matrix to analyze the results 📈.

## Conclusion
It was observed that LSTM with Glove embeddings performs the best out of all the chosen algorithms, with the highest accuracy. It also has the highest recall signifying that the less represented class of fake news is being identified accurately compared to other algorithms.
